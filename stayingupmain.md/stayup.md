If you stay up the game goes into 4OT. When you are sleeping  you end up having a weird dream where you see a bunch of basketballs running around . WHen you wake up you think it was all a nightmare but you go into the kitchen to try to find your parents but where did they go? Do you move to the next city or do you stay?
